This tiny (and silly) site lets you quickly see what a color looks like without loading an annoying color picker or launching Photoshop.

To use, just navigate to
    
    http://whatisthiscolor.com/your_hex_value
    
e.g.

    http://whatisthiscolor.com/fe8222
    
It's even hand enough to change the text color if you're checking out something dark. Kudos to the PIL team for making it easy to dynamically change the favicon.

To run locally, install the requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
run the app

    python whatsthiscolor.py
    
and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)!

Built using Python, Flask, [Pillow](https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow) a better PIL (Python Image Library), and love <3
